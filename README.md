<h1 align="center">Power Interruption Bot</h1>
This python telegram bot displays locations in ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª  where power outages are expected to occur in the near future.

## Functionality
Once a week, the bot parses the KPLC website and gets the most recent PDF with a list of the places that will be affected by the scheduled power outage.

Following that, data is extracted from the pdf and saved to a text file.

Unneeded information is eliminated from the text file, and the remaining information is formatted as a nested dictionary and saved to Redis.
The code contains the specifics of how everything functions.
