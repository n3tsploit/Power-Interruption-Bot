## How it works
The bot parses the KPLC website once per week and downloads the latest pdf containing detained of areas to be affected by the planned power interruption.
It then extracts data from the pdf and saves it to a text file.Unneccesary details are removed from the text file and the rest of the data is formated into a nested dictionary which is saved to a binary shelve file for easy access.
Fine details of how everything works is in the code.
